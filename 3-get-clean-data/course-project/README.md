# README

## Introduction

This README is part of my "Getting & Cleaning Data" course project submission.

This is a course provided by Coursera and is part of Data Science Specialization by Johns Hopkins University.

This submission (and git repository) consist of tree files:

* [README.md](README.md) this file.
* [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) R language script detailed below.
* [CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md) which describes the output generated by run_analysis.R.

## Script configuration

Before running the [run_analisys.R](run_analisys.R) script you need to change the following parameter (variable at the beginning of the file).

**WORKING_DIRECTORY** change it to something that makes sense to your environment.

*NOTE*: Please note that other paths are defined on the script header. You may need to change them in case you are working on a Windows Operating System.

## Other useful parameters

Other variables that you may to change

* RESULT_FILE_PATH: in case you want to integrate that to other script or anything like that.
* SOURCE_FILE_URL: in case the source url changes.
* SKIP_DOWNLOAD_PROCESS: flag that may be turned on, in case you are debugging the script and want to skip the initial download and uncompress steps.

## Output

At the end of the process the script will generate a tidy data file (which default name is "result.txt" but is based on the *RESULT_FILE_PATH* variable).

The details of the structure of this file is detailed in [CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md) file.
